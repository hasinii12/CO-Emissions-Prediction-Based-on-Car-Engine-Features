Project OverView:
This project aims to model CO₂ emissions (g/km) based on various car engine characteristics such as engine size, fuel consumption, transmission type, and fuel type. 
By analyzing these relationships, we can gain insights into how different factors contribute to vehicle emissions and build a predictive model to estimate CO₂ output for given car specifications.

Technology Used:
Python \U0001F40D
Pandas, NumPy (Data Manipulation)
Matplotlib, Seaborn (Data Visualization)
scikit-learn (Machine Learning)
